1) Launch 4 instances as usual and add a script at the end
#!/bin/bash
apt update -y
apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
apt update -y
apt install -y docker-ce
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker

2) Edit inbound rules, all traffic

3) CONNECT TO ALL 4 INSTANCES:

On Instance 1 terminal, run: 
• docker swarm init 
• sudo docker swarm join-token manager  (to get the manager token)

On 2nd Instance: Join INSTANCE 2 AS MANAGER 
Paste the Manager token from Instance 1  

On 3rd and 4th Instance: Join INSTANCE 3 and 4 AS WORKER 
Paste the Worker token from Instance 1 

4) Perform Operations on Instance 1: 
• docker node ls  (View all nodes)
• docker node promote <worker-hostname>  (Promote Worker Node)
• docker node demote <manager-hostname>  (Demote Manager Node)

5) 
Now, Check the status of Worker node and Manager node 
Manager node should be demoted & Worker node should be promoted
